# AbPyTools
Repo with some scripts to analyse antibody sequences

This repo is still in its early days so some scripts will not be very user friendly...!
Over time I will rewrite these to be easier to use and add some data (i.e. numbering schemes for Ab)

Stuff that will be added next:
- 
- adding pI calculation
- adding some useful functions, such as comparing sequence with available datasets
- measure CDR length
- work on Python 2 and 3 compatibility
- write setup.py
- write tests
